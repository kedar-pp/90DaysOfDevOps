///===Registry & Networking in Docker===\\\

1. Docker Registry

    - A centralized place to store and manage Docker images. It's like a repository for all your containerized applications.

    - Public Registry: Docker Hub is a common public registry.

    - Private Registry: Companies often use private registries for internal image storage.

2. Docker Networking

    - Bridge Network: The default network mode. Containers on the same bridge can communicate with each other.

    - Host Network: The container shares the hostâ€™s network stack directly.

    - Overlay Network: Designed for multi-host networks, often used in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes clusters.

    - Custom Networks: You can create your own networks with specific subnets, IP ranges, and more.
