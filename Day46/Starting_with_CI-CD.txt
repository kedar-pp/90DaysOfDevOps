///====Diving In CI/CD====\\\

What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery.
It automates the software development process to speed up releases, improve quality, and make integration smoother.
CI (Continuous Integration): Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository, where automated tests and builds are run.
CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery): Automates the release process, allowing code changes to be automatically deployed to production or a staging environment.
Why Use CI/CD?
Faster releases: Code changes are delivered quickly.
Higher quality: Automated testing ensures fewer bugs.
Smooth integration: Helps avoid "integration hell" by merging code regularly.
Standard Steps in a CI/CD Pipeline
Code Integration: Merging code changes frequently.
Unit Testing: Running tests to ensure individual pieces of code work as expected.
Static Code Analysis: Checking code for bugs, vulnerabilities, or style issues.
Code Quality & Vulnerability Scanning: Ensuring the code is safe and of high quality.
Build Automation: Automating the process of compiling and building the code.
Reporting: Generating reports on the build status, test results, and code quality.
Deployment Automation: Automatically deploying code to various environments (testing, staging, production).
Monitoring and Feedback: Tracking the performance and stability of the application.
Tools & Technologies Explored
Maven: Used for build automation in Java projects.
JUnit: A testing framework for writing and running tests.
SonarQube: For static code analysis and tracking code quality.
ALM Tools (Application Lifecycle Management): Used for version control, reporting, and tracking.
Kubernetes & Docker: For containerizing applications and deploying them in various environments like EC2.
Real-Time Scenarios
E-commerce: Ensures fast releases to handle new features or bug fixes quickly.
Finance: Automates testing for secure code changes in banking apps.
Healthcare: Deploys software updates while maintaining high reliability.
