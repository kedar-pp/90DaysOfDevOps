Part 1: Basic Concepts
1. IP Addressing

• Concept: IP addresses are unique identifiers for devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other.

•Types:
    • IPv4: 192.168.0.1 (32-bit address).
    • IPv6: fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a (128-bit address).
• Real-Time DevOps Example: Assigning static IP addresses to production servers ensures  they always have the same address for consistency in service communication.

• Windows: Use ipconfig to check the IP address.
• Linux: Use ip a to view IP configurations.
