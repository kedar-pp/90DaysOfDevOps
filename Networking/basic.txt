\\*** All Basic concepts Of Networking for DevOps  ***///

Part 1: Basic Concepts
1. IP Addressing

• Concept: IP addresses are unique identifiers for devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other.

•Types:
    • IPv4: 192.168.0.1 (32-bit address).
    • IPv6: fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a (128-bit address).
• Real-Time DevOps Example: Assigning static IP addresses to production servers ensures  they always have the same address for consistency in service communication.

• Windows: Use ipconfig to check the IP address.
• Linux: Use ip a to view IP configurations.

2. DNS (Domain Name System)

• Concept: DNS translates human-readable domain names (like myapp.com) to IP addresses (like 192.168.0.10).

• Real-Time DevOps Example: When deploying microservices, you may need to set up DNS to map your services to specific domains, ensuring easy access and routing.

• Windows: Use nslookup myapp.com.
• Linux: Use dig myapp.com.

3. MAC Address

• Concept: A unique identifier assigned to each network interface (hardware-based).

• Real-Time DevOps Example: In a cloud environment, monitoring MAC addresses helps track devices and prevent unauthorized access.

• Windows: Use getmac to display the MAC address.
• Linux: Use ifconfig or ip link show.
