1. Firewall Management

• Concept: A firewall controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.

• Real-Time DevOps Example: In a production environment, firewalls restrict access to databases or internal services, allowing only trusted IPs or services to interact.

• Windows: Use netsh advfirewall to configure.

• Linux: Use iptables, firewalld, or ufw to manage firewall rules.

   • Example: Block all incoming traffic except SSH with ufw allow ssh and ufw default  deny incoming.
