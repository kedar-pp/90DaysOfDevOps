///====Starting with docker ====\\\

1. Docker :- 
        Docker is a platform that f=helps devlopers build , share ,run applications with container

    -real time Scenario to use docker (Use case)
        - Dev1- Started project
          Dev2- Join after 2 years

          Now frameworks and library version has updated & some library or code not working properly 
        
        ***Then their comes a solution :-

            - A docker container has everything about a project like code, runtime , sytem tools , system libraries and settings with specific version.

                -eg . for project we need :-
                        - Node js 16 
                          NPM 7.2
                          React 16.3
                          Webpack 4
                          jest 23.1.0
                      we have to put this in docker,After 10 years we will get the same versions and the project will run
