///===Starting with Docker and Virtualization ===\\\

1.What is Virtualization?

    -Definition: Virtualization creates a virtual version of physical resources, such as servers, storage devices, and network resources.

    - Purpose: Enables efficient resource utilization and flexibility in managing IT environments.

2. Types of Virtualization

    - Hardware Virtualization:

        - Uses a hypervisor to create and manage virtual machines (VMs).

        - Example: Running multiple Windows and Linux VMs on a single physical server to maximize resource usage.

    - OS-Level Virtualization:

        - Allows multiple isolated user-space instances (containers) to run on a single operating system.

        - Example: Using Docker to deploy microservices in containers, each running different applications without interference.


======================================================================


3. Docker vs Virtual Machines

    - Docker: Utilizes OS-level virtualization, sharing the host OS kernel, leading to lightweight and faster deployment.

    - Virtual Machines: Each VM runs a full OS, making them heavier and slower to start.

    - Example: Deploying a web application in Docker containers is faster and uses less memory than deploying the same application in multiple VMs.
