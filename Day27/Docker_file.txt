    - A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

    - Helps automate creating consistent environments across dev, testing, and production.

2. Basic Dockerfile Instructions:

FROM: Specifies the base image (e.g., FROM ubuntu:latest).
COPY: Copies files from the host to the container (e.g., COPY . /app).
RUN: Executes commands inside the container during image build (e.g., RUN apt-get install -y nodejs).
CMD: Sets the default command to run when the container starts (e.g., CMD ["node", "app.js"]).
EXPOSE: Defines the port the container will listen on (e.g., EXPOSE 8080).
