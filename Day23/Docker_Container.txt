///====Containers In Docker====\\\

1. What is Container?
    - Containers are isolated processes for each of our app's compaonents
    - Each component - the frontend react app, Python API engine , and the database , runs in its own isolated enc=vironment , completely isolated from everything else on your machine.

    - Features :-
            - Self-contained. Each container has everything it needs to function with no reliance on any pre-installed dependencies on the host machine.

            - Isolated. Since containers are run in isolation, they have minimal influence on the host and other containers, increasing the security of your applications.

            - Independent. Each container is independently managed. Deleting one container won't affect any others.

            - Portable. Containers can run anywhere! The container that runs on your development machine will work the same way in a data center or anywhere in the cloud!


2. What are images in Docker?

    - A container image is a standardized package that includes all of the files, binaries, libraries, and configurations to run a container.

    -For a PostgreSQL image, that image will package the database binaries, config files, and other dependencies. For a Python web app, it'll include the Python runtime, your app code, and all of its dependencies.

        - There are two important principles of images:

            - Images are immutable. Once an image is created, it can't be modified. You can only make a new image or add changes on top of it.

            - Container images are composed of layers. Each layer represented a set of file system changes that add, remove, or modify files.
