///====Containers In Docker====\\\

1. What is Container?
    - Containers are isolated processes for each of our app's compaonents
    - Each component - the frontend react app, Python API engine , and the database , runs in its own isolated enc=vironment , completely isolated from everything else on your machine.

    - Features :-
            - Self-contained. Each container has everything it needs to function with no reliance on any pre-installed dependencies on the host machine.

            - Isolated. Since containers are run in isolation, they have minimal influence on the host and other containers, increasing the security of your applications.

            - Independent. Each container is independently managed. Deleting one container won't affect any others.

            - Portable. Containers can run anywhere! The container that runs on your development machine will work the same way in a data center or anywhere in the cloud!
