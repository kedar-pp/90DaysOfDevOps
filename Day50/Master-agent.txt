1. What is a Multi-Node Jenkins Pipeline?
•	A multi-node pipeline allows Jenkins to distribute tasks across multiple machines (nodes).
•	Helps in efficient build execution, load balancing, and parallel processing.
2. Why Use a Multi-Node Pipeline?
•	Load Distribution: Helps distribute workload among different machines.
•	Specialized Tasks: Different nodes can perform specific tasks (e.g., testing, deployment).
•	Scalability: Makes it easy to add more nodes to accommodate higher workloads.
3. Steps to Set Up a Multi-Node Jenkins Pipeline
Step 1: Generate SSH Keys
•	Generate SSH keys for secure communication between the master node and agent nodes.
•	Command:
css
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
•	Add the public key to the agent node.
•	Command:
sql
Copy code
ssh-copy-id user@agent-node-ip
Step 2: Configure Jenkins to Use the Agent Node
•	Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes and Clouds > New Node.
•	Configure the new node's details (name, number of executors, remote root directory).
•	Set up Launch Method as Launch agents via SSH and enter the SSH credentials.
Step 3: Write a Pipeline Script
•	Example pipeline:
groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Run on Master') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello from the Master Node!'
            }
        }
        stage('Run on Agent') {
            agent {
                label 'agent-node'
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Hello from the Agent Node!'
                sh 'mkdir -p /tmp/devops'
                echo 'DevOps directory created on the Agent Node.'
            }
        }
    }
}
•	This script runs tasks on the master and then on the agent node.
4. Real-World Scenarios for Multi-Node Pipelines
•	Load Balancing: Spread the workload across multiple nodes for faster builds.
•	Environment-Specific Tasks: Use different nodes for development, testing, and production.
•	Resource Utilization: Allocate specific nodes for resource-intensive tasks.
5. Commands Used in This Setup
•	Generate SSH keys: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
•	Copy SSH key to the agent node: ssh-copy-id user@agent-node-ip
•	Verify the SSH connection: ssh user@agent-node-ip
•	Start and stop Jenkins services: service jenkins start and service jenkins stop
6. Benefits of Using Multi-Node Pipelines
•	Improves build speed and efficiency.
•	Allows for the use of different environments.
•	Enhances the ability to handle large-scale projects.
7. Next Steps
•	Explore more advanced Jenkins pipeline configurations.
•	Learn to integrate Jenkins with tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
•	Continue practicing CI/CD pipelines for different real-world scenarios
