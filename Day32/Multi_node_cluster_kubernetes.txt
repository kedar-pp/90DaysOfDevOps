///=== Multi Node Cluster Kubernetes ===\\\

1. Set Up Virtual Machines on VMware

    - You need to create multiple virtual machines (VMs) to simulate a real-world Kubernetes cluster:

        - Master Node: Controls the cluster.

        - Worker Nodes: Execute the applications (pods) and handle workloads.

    - Steps:

        - Open VMware and create VMs for both the master and worker nodes.

        - Install CentOS on all VMs.
    
        - Ensure they all have unique hostnames and static IPs.
