///====Ansible Playbooks====\\\

1. What are Ansible Playbooks?

•	Definition: Playbooks are YAML files in Ansible that define a set of tasks for automating processes across multiple servers.
•	Purpose: They help automate repetitive tasks like software installation, server updates, and configurations.
•	Key Benefit: Playbooks bring efficiency, standardization, and simplicity to DevOps automation.

2. Why Use Playbooks?
•	Scalability: Quickly apply changes across many servers at once.
•	Consistency: Ensure every server is configured the same way.
•	Simplicity: Clear, human-readable YAML syntax makes it easy to manage and update.

3. How to Write a Playbook
1.	Define Hosts: Specify which servers the tasks should run on.
2.	List Tasks: Each task represents an action (e.g., install software, display information).
3.	Use Modules: Ansible has modules (like apt for package management, service for controlling services) that make it easy to write tasks.

4. Step-by-Step Commands & Tasks
Task 1: Display Date on Remote Servers
•	Objective: Create a playbook that outputs the date on each remote server.
•	Commands:
o	Define hosts.
o	Write a task using the command module to run date.
Task 2: Install NGINX on a Server
•	Objective: Automate NGINX installation for consistent setup across servers.
•	Steps:
o	Define the server group for NGINX.
o	Use the apt module to install NGINX.
o	Start and enable the service with the service module.
Task 3: Common DevOps Task Example
•	Objective: Automate a commonly-used setup, like creating user accounts or setting up environment variables.
•	Approach:
o	Define the server group.
o	Use tasks to add users, set permissions, or configure environment variables as needed.

5. Real-World Scenarios

    •	Application Deployment: Deploy apps across multiple servers with a single playbook.

    •	Environment Setup: Ensure each server has the same configuration and software versions.

    •	Routine Maintenance: Schedule regular updates or cleanups to keep systems consistent.
