///====Volume & Bind Volume ====\\\

1. Docker Volume

    - Purpose: Docker volumes are used to persist data generated and used by Docker containers, so even if the container is deleted, the data is retained.

    - How it works: Volumes are stored outside the containerâ€™s filesystem and managed by Docker itself, making them ideal for sharing data between multiple containers.

Task 1 : 
        - Pulling image of mysql , adding some data ,delteing the container , creating new container & then checkout ould data
