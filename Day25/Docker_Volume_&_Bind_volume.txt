///====Volume & Bind Volume ====\\\

1. Docker Volume

    - Purpose: Docker volumes are used to persist data generated and used by Docker containers, so even if the container is deleted, the data is retained.

    - How it works: Volumes are stored outside the containerâ€™s filesystem and managed by Docker itself, making them ideal for sharing data between multiple containers.

Task 1 : 
        - Pulling image of mysql , adding some data ,delteing the container , creating new container & then checkout ould data


============================================================================

2. Bind Volume / Bind Mount

    - Purpose: Bind mounts are used to mount a file or directory from the host machine into a container, allowing real-time synchronization between the host and container files.

    -How it works: Changes made inside the container immediately reflect on the host system and vice versa, making it useful for development environments where real-time feedback is crucial.

Task 2 :
        - Adding directory in container in syncronhus way
        -if we make change in container file then it also change outside the contianer file also and vice-versa
