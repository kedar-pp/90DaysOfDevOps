///====Red Hat User Management, Permissions, and Automation===\\\

1. User Management in Red Hat
    - Adding a New User:
        - To create a new user on the system

            -sudo useradd username
            -sudo passwd username

        - This adds a new user and sets their password.
        - Used when onboarding new employees or adding service accounts.

    - Modifying a User:
        -To change a user's details, like adding them to a group:

            - sudo usermod -aG groupname username

        -This adds the user to a specific group, giving them extra privileges (e.g., admin rights).

    - Deleting a User:
        - To remove a user from the system:

            - sudo userdel username

        - Used when someone leaves the company, removing their access.

2. File Permissions and Ownership

    -Changing File Ownership:
        - To assign a file to a different user or group:

            -sudo chown user:group filename

        - Used when you want to give someone control of a file.

    - Changing Permissions:
        - To control who can read, write, or execute a file:

            - chmod 755 filename

        - 755 means the owner can read/write/execute, others can only read/execute.

    - Viewing Permissions:
        - To see the current permissions of files:
            - ls -l /path/to/file
        - Displays permissions, ownership, and more info about the file.

3. Automating with Shell Scripts
    - Creating Users with a Script:
        - Automate adding multiple users:

            - #!/bin/bash
              echo "Enter username:"
              read username
              sudo useradd $username
              sudo passwd $username
              echo "User $username added!"

        - Saves time when adding many users by automating the process.

    - Changing User Passwords:
        -To update or set a password:

            -sudo passwd username

        -Ensures users update passwords as required.
