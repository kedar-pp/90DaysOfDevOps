///====Regenerate Strategy , Resource Request and Limit====\\\

1. Regenerate Strategy in Kubernetes:
What is it?
A strategy used by Kubernetes to manage how updates to your application are applied.
Types:
Rolling Update: Gradually replaces old pods with new ones to avoid downtime.
Recreate: Deletes all current pods first, then creates new ones, causing temporary downtime.
Why it matters: Ensures smooth updates with minimal service interruption.
2. Resource Requests:
What is it?
It defines the minimum CPU and memory a container needs to run.
Why it's important: Helps Kubernetes efficiently assign containers to nodes that have the required resources.
Example:

    resources:
        requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
