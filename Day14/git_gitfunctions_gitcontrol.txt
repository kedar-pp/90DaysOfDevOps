///===Git & GitHub For DevOps===\\\

1. Git & Github Basics
    -Git is VCS --> Version Control System
    -In Project their should be a record of Time,Author, commit , date of modidification ,etc
    -By using git we can go to previous versions


    -GitHub is a platform where it gives VCS similar to git

    -Gitlab is also platform used VCS 

    -BitBucket is also same as both 

    these uses git only in bacground (or we can say the working is similar to git) 

    they all used for CODE Management , these all vary in industries according to companies

    -Difference between file system and VCS(Version Control System)
        -In filesystem, we cannot recover the deleted stuff .
        -In Git VCS , we have option to recover or their is option to Rollback to older versions

Git:
    -What is Git?

    -Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and allows multiple people to collaborate on a project efficiently.

    -It helps in keeping a history of code changes, making it easy to revert, branch, or merge code.

=========================================================================================

Basic Git Commands:
    -git init: Initializes a new Git repository.

    -git clone <URL>: Clones (copies) a repository from GitHub or another remote location.

    -git add <file>: Stages changes (adds files to be tracked).

    -git commit -m "message": Saves your changes with a message describing what was done.

    -git status: Shows the status of your working directory (staged, modified, or untracked files).

    -git push: Pushes the committed changes to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).

    -git pull: Pulls the latest changes from the remote repository to your local machine.

    -git branch: Lists all branches or creates a new one (git branch <branch-name>).

    -git checkout <branch>: Switches to the specified branch.

=========================================================================================


What is GitHub?

    -GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It enables you to share code, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects.

    -GitHub adds a social layer to Git with features like pull requests, issues, and discussions.

=========================================================================================


Key GitHub Concepts:

    -Repository (Repo): A project with its code and version history.

    -Forking: Creating a copy of someone else's repository to make changes or contributions.

    -Pull Request (PR): A method of submitting contributions to a project. A PR allows you to propose changes that can be reviewed and merged.

    -Issues: A way to track bugs, features, or tasks related to the project.

    -Stars: A way to bookmark or show appreciation for a repository.

    -Actions: Automating tasks like running tests, deploying code, etc.
