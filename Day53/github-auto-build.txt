///====Github Auto Build====\\\


Today, I learned how to automate build jobs in Jenkins using Poll SCM, which allows Jenkins to automatically trigger builds when code is committed to GitHub.

Key Points:
Poll SCM in Jenkins:
Poll SCM checks for changes in the GitHub repository at scheduled intervals.
If a new commit is detected, it triggers an automatic build without manual intervention.
Steps I Followed:
Set up a job in Jenkins and link it to my GitHub repository.
Enable Poll SCM in Jenkins under the job configuration.
Specify the polling schedule (e.g., check for changes every minute).
Push changes to the GitHub repository.
Jenkins automatically detects the commit and triggers a build.
Real-Time Scenarios:
Continuous Integration (CI): Every time developers commit code, automated tests are run to check for errors or issues in the code.
Automated Deployments: Once a build passes, the code can be automatically deployed to a staging or production environment.
This process helps ensure the stability of the code by testing it automatically and reduces manual intervention for building or deploying projects.

This is an essential practice in modern DevOps workflows to enhance efficiency and automation.
