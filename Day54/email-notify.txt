///====Email Notify On Job Faliure====\\\

1. What is SMTP?

    •	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol used to send emails between servers.

    •	In Jenkins, we configure SMTP settings to enable automated email alerts directly from our CI/CD pipeline.

============================================================================================================================================


2. Why Use Email Notifications in Jenkins?

    •	Automates communication about build status, failures, and deployments.

    •	Reduces manual monitoring, allowing teams to respond to issues immediately.
    
    •	Provides essential updates on task completion, making team collaboration smoother and more efficient.

============================================================================================================================================


3. Post-Build Actions: Setting Up Email Notifications
    
    •	Post-Build Actions in Jenkins allow users to set up specific actions that execute after a build completes.

    •	You can configure email notifications as a post-build action:
    
    o	Alerts can be sent for successful builds, failures, or unstable jobs.

    o	Customize recipients based on the type of event to keep relevant team members in the loop.

============================================================================================================================================


4. Real-Time Scenarios for Email Notifications

    •	Development and Testing: Notifies developers about broken builds or errors right after a commit.

    •	Production Deployments: Keeps stakeholders updated on successful deployments, helping with tracking production status.

    •	Alerts for Quick Response: Immediate alerts to infrastructure or DevOps teams for quick response to any deployment issues.

============================================================================================================================================


5. Steps to Configure Email Notifications

    •	Configure SMTP settings under Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System.

    •	In the Post-Build Actions section of your Jenkins job:

    o	Add Email Notification or Extended Email Notification for advanced settings.

    o	Set conditions for notifications (like on failure or success).

    o	Define recipient emails and customize message content if needed.

Key Benefits

    •	Increased Awareness: Automated emails keep everyone informed about job status and build health.

    •	Efficiency Boost: No need to manually check Jenkins; alerts come directly to email inboxes.

    •	Faster Fixes: Helps team members quickly address issues as soon as they arise.
