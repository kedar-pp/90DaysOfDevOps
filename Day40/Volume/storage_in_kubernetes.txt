1. What are Volumes in Kubernetes?
Volumes allow containers within Pods to access and share data.
They are decoupled from the container's lifecycle, meaning data can persist even if a container restarts.
2. emptyDir Volume:
Purpose: Temporary storage that lasts as long as the Pod is running.
Lifecycle: Data in an emptyDir is deleted when the Pod is deleted.
Use Case: Good for temporary storage like caching, intermediate data, or processing tasks that don't need to be saved after the Pod's lifecycle.
Example: When you need fast, temporary storage for operations within a Pod, like running a web server where cache files can be regenerated if lost.

        volumes:
        - name: emptydirvolume
        emptyDir: {}
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
        name: emptydirvolume
