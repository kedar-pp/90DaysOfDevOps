///====More about Variables====\\\

1. Why Use Variables?
Flexibility: Instead of hardcoding values, variables make configurations adaptable. We can modify them without changing core files, enabling seamless environment switches (e.g., from dev to production).
Clean Code Structure: By placing variables in separate files like variables.tf, the code becomes more organized, making updates easy without direct changes to main.tf.
2. Creating Variables in variables.tf
Purpose: In variables.tf, you can specify any value that might need updating, such as file names or content, which allows us to manage configurations in one place.
Use Case Example: A team can define environment-specific paths, database settings, or API keys as variables, adapting them per environment without adjusting the main configuration.
3. Accessing Variables in main.tf
By referencing variables in main.tf, we ensure that configuration changes apply across the setup, keeping the infrastructure consistent and easy to adjust.
Real-World Scenario: In a project where multiple team members use different environments, specifying variable paths centrally simplifies file management.
4. Using Environment Variables
Dynamic Configurations: Environment variables are handy when we need to set values temporarily or configure secrets securely without adding them directly to files.
Example in DevOps: This method works well for changing credentials or dynamically updating settings based on runtime conditions (e.g., user roles, database passwords).
5. Practical Applications
Adaptable Environments: With variables, teams can quickly switch configurations for dev, test, and prod environments without editing main infrastructure files.
Efficient Scaling: Configurable setups make it easy to adjust instances or deploy configurations for different project needs, especially in agile development setups.
