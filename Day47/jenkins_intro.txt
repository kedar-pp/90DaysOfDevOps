1. What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?
SDLC is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software.
Common phases include:
Requirements Gathering: Understanding what needs to be developed.
Design: Planning the architecture of the software.
Development: Writing the code.
Testing: Checking for bugs and verifying functionality.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance: Updating and fixing issues post-release.
Real-World Example: An e-commerce app where the SDLC ensures smooth functionality, from browsing items to making purchases.

2. DevOps Culture
A collaborative approach that unites development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.
Focuses on automating processes to speed up software delivery.
Reduces silos between teams for better communication and quicker issue resolution.
Emphasizes continuous feedback and improvement for consistent software quality.
Real-World Scenario: Companies using DevOps practices can push software updates multiple times a day instead of once a month.

3. Jenkins for CI/CD Automation
What is Jenkins?
An open-source tool used to automate building, testing, and deploying code changes.
Helps in achieving continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD).
Why use Jenkins?
Supports a wide range of plugins for integrating various tools.
Automates repetitive tasks, making the development process more efficient.
Free to use and highly customizable.
How Jenkins Works:

Developers push code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
Jenkins automatically builds the new code, runs tests, and, if successful, deploys it.
Reduces human errors and speeds up the deployment cycle.

4. Other CI/CD Tools (Alternatives to Jenkins)
GitLab CI: Built-in CI/CD in GitLab, good for version control and DevOps.
CircleCI: Cloud-based, known for speed and scalability.
Bamboo: Integrated with Atlassian tools, suitable for larger teams.
TeamCity: Great for .NET projects, offers detailed build configuration.
5. Feasibility Considerations When Choosing a CI/CD Tool
Project Size: Bigger projects may need tools that support more integrations.
Team Expertise: Choose a tool that the team is familiar with.
Budget: Some tools are free, while others have licensing costs.
Plugin Support: Jenkins has a large plugin ecosystem, making it versatile.
Key Takeaways:

Understanding SDLC helps streamline software development.
DevOps culture fosters better collaboration between development and operations teams.
Jenkins is a powerful tool for automating CI/CD but evaluating other tools is essential to find the best fit.
