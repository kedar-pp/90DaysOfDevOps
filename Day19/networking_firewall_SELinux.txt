1. Networking in Red Hat
    - View Network Interfaces:
    - Use the ip a command to list all network interfaces and see their IP addresses.
    - Example:
        - ip a

    - Configure Network Interfaces:
        Edit the network configuration file (/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0) to manually set a static IP address.

    - Test Network Connectivity:
        Use ping to check if your server can communicate with another machine or website.

        - Example:
            - ping google.com
