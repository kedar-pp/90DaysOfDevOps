What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose helps run multi-container applications using a simple configuration file (YAML).
It manages services, networks, and volumes required for an application.
Why use Docker Compose?

Simplifies managing complex applications by defining them in one file.
Useful for development, testing, and CI/CD workflows.
Core Concepts:

Services: Individual containers (like web, database) in an app.
Networks: Links containers to allow communication.
Volumes: Stores data outside the container, enabling persistence.
Basic Docker Compose Commands:

docker-compose up – Starts all services.
docker-compose down – Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes.
docker-compose build – Builds the images defined in the YAML file.
docker-compose ps – Lists running containers.
docker-compose logs – Shows container logs.
YAML for Docker Compose:

YAML is used to define services, volumes, and networks.
Example structure:
    - version: '3'
      services:
        web:
            image: nginx
            ports:
              - "80:80"
        db:
            image: mysql
            environment:
                MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
