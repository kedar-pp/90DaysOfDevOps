1. What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose helps run multi-container applications using a simple configuration file (YAML).
It manages services, networks, and volumes required for an application.

2. Why use Docker Compose?

Simplifies managing complex applications by defining them in one file.
Useful for development, testing, and CI/CD workflows.


=================================================================================================================================


3. Core Concepts:

Services: Individual containers (like web, database) in an app.
Networks: Links containers to allow communication.
Volumes: Stores data outside the container, enabling persistence.


=================================================================================================================================


4. Basic Docker Compose Commands:

docker-compose up – Starts all services.
docker-compose down – Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes.
docker-compose build – Builds the images defined in the YAML file.
docker-compose ps – Lists running containers.
docker-compose logs – Shows container logs.

5. YAML for Docker Compose:

YAML is used to define services, volumes, and networks.
Example structure:
    - version: '3'
      services:
        web:
            image: nginx
            ports:
              - "80:80"
        db:
            image: mysql
            environment:
                MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password

6. Real-World Scenario Example:

    - Deploying a full-stack app with Docker Compose:
        - Frontend: React
          Backend: Node.js
          Database: MySQL
          NGINX: As a reverse proxy

7. Advanced Features:

Scaling: docker-compose up --scale web=3 to run multiple instances.
Environment Variables: Define different settings for dev and prod environments.
Multi-stage builds: Optimize images by reducing size in final stages.

8. Docker Compose in CI/CD Pipelines:

Automated testing and deployments can be integrated with CI tools like Jenkins or GitLab.
Simplifies testing multiple containers and services at once.

9. Scaling Applications with Docker Compose:

Manage multiple instances of services and handle scaling in production.
Load balancing can be set up to distribute traffic across containers.

10. Practical Use Cases:

Set up complex testing environments.
Replicate production environments locally for testing.
Efficiently deploy microservices architecture.
