Comparison of vi and nano editors :-

vi Editor:-
    -Available on almost all Unix/Linux systems by default
    -Has multiple modes (insert, command, etc.) 
    -Lightweight and fast, ideal for large files
    -Requires memorization of commands (e.g., :wq, :q!)
    -Limited undo (one step back with u)

nano Editor:-
    -Not always pre-installed (can be installed via package manager)
    -Single mode (no need to switch between modes)
    -Slightly slower with large files
    -Key shortcuts are displayed (e.g., ^O to save, ^X to exit)
    -Multiple undo/redo steps (^U for undo, ^R for redo)
