///====Role Based Access Control , Role Binding====\\\

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes
What is RBAC?

RBAC is a method for regulating access to resources in Kubernetes based on the roles assigned to users, groups, or service accounts.
It ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions on Kubernetes resources, following the principle of least privilege.
Components of RBAC:

Role: Specifies access permissions within a namespace (like read or write access to pods).
RoleBinding: Assigns a Role to a user, group, or service account within a specific namespace.
ClusterRole: Similar to Role but applicable across the entire cluster (not limited to a namespace).
ClusterRoleBinding: Binds a ClusterRole to a user, group, or service account across all namespaces in the cluster.
Why Use RBAC?

It provides fine-grained access control over Kubernetes resources.
Ensures secure access to resources, preventing unauthorized actions.
Supports both namespace-specific and cluster-wide permissions.
2. Practical Example of Setting Up RBAC
    - Creating a Role in a Namespace:

        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: Role
        metadata:
            namespace: dev
            name: developer-role
        rules:
            - apiGroups: [""]
            resources: ["pods"]
            verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "delete"]

    - Binding the Role to a User:

        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: RoleBinding
        metadata:
            name: dev-rolebinding
            namespace: dev
        subjects:
            - kind: User
            name: "developer-user"
            apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        roleRef:
            kind: Role
            name: developer-role
            apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

Real-Time Scenario:

Use RBAC to give developers limited access to development namespaces while restricting access to production environments.
3. Key and Certificate Management in Kubernetes
Importance:

Securing communication between components in Kubernetes (e.g., API server and nodes) requires keys and certificates.
Certificates ensure that data exchanged between components is encrypted and authenticated.
Generating Keys and Certificates Using OpenSSL:

Step 1: Generate a private key.

    openssl genrsa -out my-key.key 2048

Step 2: Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

    openssl req -new -key my-key.key -out my-csr.csr

Step 3: Sign the CSR to create a certificate.

    openssl x509 -req -in my-csr.csr -signkey my-key.key -out my-cert.crt

Real-Time Scenario:

Use keys and certificates to establish secure communication between the Kubernetes API server and worker nodes.

4. Tasks Performed
Task 1: Setting Up RBAC

Created roles and role bindings to allow a developer user to access specific resources in a development namespace.
Configured cluster-wide access using ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings.
Task 2: Generating Keys and Certificates

Practiced creating private keys and signing certificates using OpenSSL.
Applied certificates to secure communications in the Kubernetes cluster.
5. Additional Points and Real-Time Examples
Follow the Principle of Least Privilege:
Grant only the minimum permissions necessary to users and applications.
Use Service Accounts for Automation:
For automated tasks, create service accounts with the appropriate RBAC permissions to avoid using administrative credentials.
Regularly Audit RBAC Policies:
Review RBAC settings periodically to ensure that only necessary permissions are in place.
