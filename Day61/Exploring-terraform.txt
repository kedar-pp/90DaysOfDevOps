1. Introduction to Terraform and HCL
Terraform: A tool for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate the setup of infrastructure.
HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language): A language used in Terraform files for defining and provisioning infrastructure.
2. Creating a Simple Terraform File

                content = "I want to become a DevOps Engineer who knows Terraform"
        }
